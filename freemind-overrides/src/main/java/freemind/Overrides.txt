    Modified freemind.main.FreeMind to restore the default security manager so
    that security policies, if enabled at JVM start, are enforced.
    
[2023-12-27]
    Modified freemind.view.mindmapview.MapView to disable "scrolling to 
    selected node" on mouse click over a blank area in the mind map.
    This avoids the unexpected jumpiness when navigating in a map.

[2024-04-21]
    Modified freemind.modes.mindmapmode.actions.PasteAction to skip pasting
    image content if some other data (text, HTML, etc.) has been identified.
    This is to avoid the unnecessary generation of an image file when 
    pasting texts copied from Microsoft applications (Word, Excel, Outlook).

[2024-11-24]
    Modified freemind.modes.mindmapmode.actions.ToggleFoldedAction to indicate
    map change when "resources_save_folding_state=false" in auto.properties so
    that FreeMind will allow the map to be saved 

[2024-12-01]
    Provide optional support for FlatLaf look and feels (including FlatDarkLaf)

[2024-12-01]
    Removed modifications to freemind.main.FreeMind from [2023-05-04] due to
    undesirable side effects, e.g. FreeMind is unable to detect if another
    FreeMind instance is running, leading to concurrent modifications to maps.

[2024-12-01]
    Modified accessories.plugins.NodeHistory to center destination node after
    a 'back' or 'forward' navigation action.

[2024-12-05]
    Following up to changes in 2024-11-24, modified the following classes to
    trigger hierarchical icon display updates when nodes are folded: 
      - freemind.modes.ControllerAdapter
      - freemind.modes.mindmapmode.actions.ToggleFoldedAction

[2024-12-12]
    Related to changes in 2024-12-05, modified
    accessories.plugins.HierarchicalIcons to reduce delay when closing a mind
    map or Freemind

[2025-01-22]
    Add keyboard shortcut configuration for "Save All" by adding the attribute
    key_stroke in the element plugin_action in accessories\plugins\SaveAll.xml

[2025-01-24]
    Reworked the hack in freemind.modes.ControllerAdapter from 2024-12-05 due
    to stack overflow with the "modification timestamp" feature.

[2025-01-24]
    Override freemind.modes.ControllerAdapter to use simple HTML converter
    for better Teams / Office compatibility
